# GJ3470b Transit
Final project analyzing the transit of exoplanet Gliese 3470b for PHYS 134L taught at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
The data reduction follows the process outlined in the documentation of `photutils` for `DAOStarFinder` and aperture photometry using an annulus. 
A simple boxcar function was fitted to the resulting light curve for analysis.
